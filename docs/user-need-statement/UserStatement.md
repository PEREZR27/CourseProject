#User Need Statement
This project is a project for the MSSA program that accomplishes the following goals:

-Keeps a record of personal fitness data
-Creates reccomendations based on those results
-Changes reccomendations based on user needs and schedule to keep user on track to fitness goals

In the course of this project I will use ASP.NET and C# to build a  an online platform where users can store personal data related to fitness goals and track progress using stored algorithms which will reccomend daily calorie intake and workout suggestions. Workouts data will be preloaded into the system and will follow an eight week progression which will include five days of working out and two days of active recovery.

The Features of this project include:

-Eight week strength training / conditioning regiment that incorporates weight training and body weight excercises that takes into account age and heart rate
-A nutritional guide (MACRO calculator, meal time reminder, and sleep / rest cycle)
-Optional status updates to all major social media sites (When a user finishes a workout or hit a major milestone)

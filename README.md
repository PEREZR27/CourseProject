The Project
What is EWFA?

By utilizing the ASP.NET MVC & C#, I have created an application known as "EWFA". This project was created in a span of 18 weeks. During this project, I wanted a safe way to excercise at home especialy during the COVID-19 pandemic times. EWFA is an interesting idea that I wanted to create into an application.
